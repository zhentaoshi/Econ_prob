    "Statistic theory goes the opposite way to probability theory. In reality what we observe is a sample of data, but we don't know via what mechanism the data are generated. Statistics asks how can we infer the data generating process from the sample that we observe. For example, if we assume the sample comes from a normal distribution, what is the best way that we learn the population mean and variance? Do the data provide sufficient evidence that two samples are drawn from populations of the same means? Statistics uses the sample to compute some numbers, while the underlying probability model guides the interpretation of these numbers."

    "The beauty of statistics lies in their deep connection with philosophy. A realized sample is a set of given numbers. They are fixed, known, and invariant. But where is uncertainty? Bayesians argue that uncertainty comes from people's belief about the object of interest. The data contain information to help refine or update our beliefs. In contrast, frequentists contend that uncertainty is present  before the numbers, or realizations, are revealed; once the realizations are revealed, uncertainty is gone. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two schools of philosophical thoughts, Bayesian and frequentist, have been contesting over centuries. Either has pros and cons. Nowadays in academic research and in teaching, frequentist remains the mainstream so it is the one that we are more familiar with. However, frequentist interpretation of probability and the resulting implication for statistical inference are not completely natural. Repeated experiments are more easily perceived in physics and other natural science, but may be unrealistic in many economic settings. On the other hand, Bayesian encounters difficulty in reaching a consensus about prior distributions. "
