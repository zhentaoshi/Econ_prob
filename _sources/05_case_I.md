We live in a world of uncertainty. About 20 years ago, a student was allowed to pick one university as the first-choice. He could either make it or fail it. It is a high-stake bet with life-long consequences. 

I didn't earn a score as high as I had wished in Gaokao, and it meant that the dreams of going to Beijing and Shanghai burst like a bubble. My choice was narrowed down to Naijing University (NJU) and Zhejiang University (ZJU). At that time, the Internet was at its beginning in Mainland, and information was scant.

Zhejiang is my home province. My high school consistently sent 40+ students to ZJU, which meant ZJU was not something to earn you bragging right. 
NJU, instead, was much more exotic. I got to know it from a fellow small-town dweller, who was admitted by NJU and became an inspiring role model in town admired by every parent. NJU was, therefore, my dream school.

I managed to call a representative of NJU in charge of admission. I told him about my score and ranking, and inquired what majors I could possibly be qualified. He explained to me that my score was marginal. "Perhaps you can bid for geology," he suggested faint-heartedly. Geology was not in my list of interest. But naive as I was, I thought it was not unacceptable. I had learned stories about Li Siguang, who searched for crude oil in China. Long time spent in the wild for field work could be romantic? I guessed.

The sample space was laid out. I would pick one of two actions: ZJU or NJU, and must accept one of two consequences: success and failure. The combination makes four outcomes, each with a probability attached to it. 
Before I submitted the piece of paper signalling my willingness, and before the "cut-off points" (分数线) were announced, I was in suspension. What should I do?
